We created an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS and JS. This is a part of full stack e-commerce 
website. In this part we only created front end page's UI. We created 4 pages - Home page, Product 
Page, Search Page and 404 page.
We created Clothing E-Commerce Website which provide Best collection of all time. As we'll have 
same navbar and footer in all pages. I thought of making their styles as a separate file. So imported 
nav.js file inside home.css. And navbar related style inside nav.css.
We made page dynamically by using JavaScript. If you see the code, Inside the function first I am 
selecting nav element using querySelector method. And then writing its HTML using innerHTML. And 
the value of innerHTML is the same HTML elements that we have made in index.html file. We now 
removed the HTML elements from there and imported in nav.js
